## Features

- **Memory Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts important information from conversations to be stored as memories.
- **Memory Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity to the current context.
- **Memory Management**: Supports adding, updating, and deleting memories as needed.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Seamlessly works with OpenAI's GPT models and embedding APIs.
